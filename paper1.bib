	abstract = {The scientific study of networks, including computer networks, social networks, and biological networks, has received an enormous amount of interest in the last few years. The rise of the Internet and the wide availability of inexpensive computers have made it possible to gather and analyze network data on a large scale, and the development of a variety of new theoretical tools has allowed us to extract new knowledge from many different kinds of networks. The study of networks is broadly interdisciplinary and important developments have occurred in many fields, including mathematics, physics, computer and information sciences, biology, and the social sciences. This book brings together the most important breakthroughs in each of these fields and presents them in a coherent fashion, highlighting the strong interconnections between work in different areas. Subjects covered include the measurement and structure of networks in many branches of science, methods for analyzing network data, including methods developed in physics, statistics, and sociology, the fundamentals of graph theory, computer algorithms, and spectral methods, mathematical models of networks, including random graph models and generative models, and theories of dynamical processes taking place on networks.},

@inproceedings{Brandes2005,
	abstract = {We consider variations of two well-known centrality measures, betweenness and closeness, with a different model of information spread. Rather than along shortest paths only, it is assumed that information spreads efficiently like an electrical current. We prove that the current-flow variant of closeness centrality is identical with another known measure, information centrality, and give improved algorithms for computing both measures exactly. Since running times and space requirements are prohibitive for large networks, we also present a randomized approximation scheme for current-flow betweenness. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

	abstract = {Brain connectivity datasets comprise networks of brain regions connected by anatomical tracts or by functional associations. Complex network analysis-a new multidisciplinary approach to the study of complex systems-aims to characterize these brain networks with a small number of neurobiologically meaningful and easily computable measures. In this article, we discuss construction of brain networks from connectivity data and describe the most commonly used network measures of structural and functional connectivity. We describe measures that variously detect functional integration and segregation, quantify centrality of individual brain regions or pathways, characterize patterns of local anatomical circuitry, and test resilience of networks to insult. We discuss the issues surrounding comparison of structural and functional network connectivity, as well as comparison of networks across subjects. Finally, we describe a Matlab toolbox (http://www.brain-connectivity-toolbox.net) accompanying this article and containing a collection of complex network measures and large-scale neuroanatomical connectivity datasets.},

@article{Godwin2015,
	abstract = {Neurobiological theories of awareness propose divergent accounts of the spatial extent of brain changes that support conscious perception. Whereas focal theories posit mostly local regional changes, global theories propose that awareness emerges from the propagation of neural signals across a broad extent of sensory and association cortex. Here we tested the scalar extent of brain changes associated with awareness using graph theoretical analysis applied to functional connectivity data acquired at ultra-high field while subjects performed a simple masked target detection task. We found that awareness of a visual target is associated with a degradation of the modularity of the brain's functional networks brought about by an increase in intermodular functional connectivity. These results provide compelling evidence that awareness is associated with truly global changes in the brain's functional connectivity.},

@article{Blondel2008,
	abstract = {We propose a simple method to extract the community structure of large networks. Our method is a heuristic method that is based on modularity optimization. It is shown to outperform all other known community detection methods in terms of computation time. Moreover, the quality of the communities detected is very good, as measured by the so-called modularity. This is shown first by identifying language communities in a Belgian mobile phone network of 2 million customers and by analysing a web graph of 118 million nodes and more than one billion links. The accuracy of our algorithm is also verified on ad hoc modular networks. {\textcopyright} 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

@misc{Dorfler2018,
	abstract = {Algebraic graph theory is a cornerstone in the study of electrical networks ranging from miniature integrated circuits to continental-scale power systems. Conversely, many fundamental results of algebraic graph theory were laid out by early electrical circuit analysts. In this paper, we survey some fundamental and historic as well as recent results on how algebraic graph theory informs electrical network analysis, dynamics, and design. In particular, we review the algebraic and spectral properties of graph adjacency, Laplacian, incidence, and resistance matrices and how they relate to the analysis, network reduction, and dynamics of certain classes of electrical networks. We study these relations for models of increasing complexity ranging from static resistive direct current (dc) circuits, over dynamic resistor..inductor..capacitor (RLC) circuits, to nonlinear alternating current (ac) power flow. We conclude this paper by presenting a set of fundamental open questions at the intersection of algebraic graph theory and electrical networks.},

@techreport{Estrada2008,
	abstract = {We propose a new measure of the communicability of a complex network, which is a broad generalization of the concept of the shortest path. According to the new measure, most of the real-world networks display the largest communicability between the most connected (popular) nodes of the network (assortative communicability). There are also several networks with the disassortative communicability, where the most "popular" nodes communicate very poorly to each other. Using this information we classify a diverse set of real-world complex systems into a small number of universality classes based on their structure-dynamic correlation. In addition, the new communicability measure is able to distinguish finer structures of networks, such as communities into which a network is divided. A community is unambiguously defined here as a set of nodes displaying larger communicability among them than to the rest of the nodes in the network. {\textcopyright} 2008 The American Physical Society.},

@article{Crofts2009,
	abstract = {Recent advances in experimental neuroscience allow non-invasive studies of the white matter tracts in the human central nervous system, thus making available cutting-edge brain anatomical data describing these global connectivity patterns. Through magnetic resonance imaging, this non-invasive technique is able to infer a snapshot of the cortical network within the living human brain. Here, we report on the initial success of a new weighted network communicability measure in distinguishing local and global differences between diseased patients and controls. This approach builds on recent advances in network science, where an underlying connectivity structure is used as a means to measure the ease with which information can flow between nodes. One advantage of our method is that it deals directly with the real-valued connectivity data, thereby avoiding the need to discretize the corresponding adjacency matrix, i.e. to round weights up to 1 or down to 0, depending upon some threshold value. Experimental results indicate that the new approach is able to extract biologically relevant features that are not immediately apparent from the raw connectivity data. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Royal Society.},
